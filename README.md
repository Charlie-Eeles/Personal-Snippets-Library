What is Personal Snippets Library?
PSL is a streamlined way of storing small snippets of code for reference and reuse.
Snippets are saved as a .txt file in the psl folder in your appdata folder.

The drop down menu to change language of the code editor only has a few of the most common languages,
if you'd like to add more then just go to the index.html and add your language of choice to the input tag.

This is an Electron app:
to run a development app run "npm start" in your terminal and "rs" in node to restart. 
to build after making changes simply run "npm run make" in your terminal.

Please ignore the dreadful html/css, I'll get back to it.
